role: Undergraduate Research Assistant in Biostatistics
bio: |
  I am a dedicated and proactive final-year student pursuing an Interuniversity Bachelor's Degree in Statistics at the Universitat de Barcelona and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya,
  with a strong academic focus on advanced quantitative methods, statistical modeling, and their application to biomedical sciences.
  
  Professionally, I serve as an Undergraduate Research Assistant within the GRBIO Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Research Group at the Department of Statistics and Operations Research (UPC-BarcelonaTech). 
  In this role, I am actively involved in methodological research and software development. My key contributions include extending the functionality of the R package Go/Cens for survival analysis 
  and developing the Shiny web application MSMPred for multistate predictive modeling, tools designed to enhance statistical practice in clinical research.
  
  Beyond programming, I engage in the full spectrum of research activities. This encompasses rigorous code review and debugging to ensure reproducibility, 
  managing the group's digital communication via its website and newsletter, and coordinating biweekly research seminars that bridge the gap between clinicians, biostatisticians, and international researchers. 
  
  My technical expertise is grounded in advanced proficiency in R (including Shiny and R Markdown), SAS, and SQL, with practical experience in statistical modeling, survival analysis, and predictive analytics.
